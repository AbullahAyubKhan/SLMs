Artificial intelligence (AI) models that can analyse, comprehend, and produce natural language material are known as small language models (SLMs). SLMs are smaller than large language models (LLMs), as their name suggests.

Compared to LLMs, which have hundreds of billions or even trillions of parameters, SLMs have a few million to a few billion. A model learns parameters—internal variables like weights and biases—during training. A machine learning model's behaviour and performance are influenced by these factors.

Compared to their large model counterparts, small language models are more efficient and compact. Because of this, SLMs utilise less memory and processing power, which makes them perfect for environments with limited resources, including edge devices and mobile apps, or even situations where AI inferencing—the process by which a model responds to a user's query—must be carried out offline without a data network.

SLMs are built on top of LLMs. The transformer model is a neural network-based architecture used by small language models, just like large language models. In natural language processing (NLP), transformers have become essential components that serve as the foundation for models such as the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT).

An outline of the transformer architecture is provided below:

● Token positions and semantics are captured by encoders, which convert input sequences into numerical representations known as embeddings.

● Transformers may "focus their attention" on the most significant tokens in the input sequence, independent of their position, thanks to a self-attention mechanism.

● Decoders create the most statistically likely output sequence by utilising this self-attention process in conjunction with the encoders' embeddings.


# Model Checklist

Model Loading: HuatuoGPT-o1-8B is typically a causal language model (e.g., based on LLaMA or ChatGLM). So:
Use AutoModelForCausalLM instead of AutoModel
Tokenization doesn't use token type IDs
Input Formatting for MCQA:
Format: "context\n\nQuestion: ...\nA. ...\nB. ...\nC. ...\nD. ...\nAnswer:"
All options embedded in the prompt
No pooled output: Use the last token logits to predict the correct answer

Find the number of nickels and dimes in the coin purse. Let's define the variables first:\n- Let \\( n \\) be the number of nickels.\n- Let \\( d \\) be the number of dimes.\n\nWe are given two pieces of information:\n1. The total number of coins is 18.\n2.

# Research Problems / Limitations are find

# Research Problem
In the present outcome, we evaluate the metrices regarding the performance that we achieve while running HuatuoGPT-o1-8B when applied to a dataset comprising college-level mathematical problems. The model is tasked with answering questions that require logical reasoning, symbolic understanding, and accurate problem-solving. The model can generate comprehensive explanations, but the accuracy of the prediction is approximately 48.0% correct and 52.0% wrong, while the accuracy of the prediction is suboptimal. This result shows a significant gap in the ability of the model to consistently generate accurate solutions. A possible factor is the Boolean evaluation mechanism, which answers strictly correct or wrong, without taking into account some arguments or nearly correct output. This raises questions about the reliability of model interpretation skills and the suitability of current assessment metrics in a collection of subtle performance in complex mathematical tasks.

# Hypothesis
•	Boolean precision metric underrealized the true performance of the Huatuogpt-01-8B by not taking into account partially correct mathematical thinking.
•	Fine-tuning of Huatuogpt-01-8b using domain-specific mathematical data can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of mathematical questions at the university level.
•	The 48% accuracy rate of HuatuoGPT-01-8B is inherently affected by the effects of the structure and complexity of mathematical problems as a model limitation.
•	Huatuogpt-01-8b achieves better with arithmetic and algebraic problems than with problems that require logical reasoning or symbolic manipulation in several steps.

# Research Questions
The major research question is mentioned as follows:
1.	What are the limitations of HuatuoGPT-o1-8B in interpreting and solving symbolic and logical discussion tasks in college mathematical dataset?
2.	How HuatuGPT-o1-8B explained by the internal thinking of the model and the probabilistic understanding of mathematical data records?
3.	How can prediction inconsistencies in HuatuoGPT-01-8B be explained by the model’s internal reasoning and probabilistic understanding of mathematical datasets?
4.	What modifications or fine-tuning strategies could improve the performance of HuatuoGPT-01-8B on structured math questions in limited-data environments?
